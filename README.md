# Fragrance Catalog Hub

*A curated, scalable, and conversion-focused fragrance catalog built with modern web tooling.*

## Overview

I built this project as a **high-quality fragrance catalog platform** designed to showcase perfumes in a clean, structured, and scalable way.
The goal is simple: **turn a perfume list into a product experience**.

This project is not just a UI — it reflects real-world decisions around:

* product data modeling,
* pricing strategies by volume,
* availability states,
* and future-ready commerce flows (cart → WhatsApp → conversion).

Everything is structured to grow: more brands, more categories, more logic — without rewriting the foundation.

## What I’ve Built

* A **modular perfume catalog** with structured JSON-based product definitions
* Support for:

  * gender-based collections
  * designer, niche, and Arabic fragrances
  * multiple price tiers (2ml / 5ml / 10ml)
  * availability and launch states
* A **clean, modern UI** focused on clarity and browsing experience
* A codebase ready to evolve into:

  * shopping cart flows
  * WhatsApp checkout
  * dynamic pricing
  * promotions and bundles

This is the foundation of a real product, not a demo.

## Tech Stack

I chose a modern, fast, and flexible stack to keep development smooth and scalable:

* **Vite** – fast builds and instant feedback
* **React + TypeScript** – predictable, maintainable UI logic
* **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling for rapid iteration
* **shadcn/ui** – consistent, accessible UI components

The result is a project that’s easy to extend and enjoyable to work on.

## Local Development

If you want to run the project locally:

### Requirements

* Node.js (recommended via `nvm`)
* npm

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Go into the project folder
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

You’ll get a live preview with hot reload for fast iteration.

## Editing the Project

I actively work on this project in multiple ways depending on the task:

### Local IDE

* For deeper logic, refactors, or data modeling, I work locally and push changes normally.

### GitHub / Codespaces

* Quick fixes and reviews are handled directly through GitHub when needed.

---

## Deployment

Deployment is handled directly through **Lovable**:

* Open the project in Lovable
* Click **Share → Publish**
* The latest version goes live instantly

Custom domains are supported and can be configured directly from the project settings.

## Vision

This project is designed to grow into a **commerce-ready fragrance platform** with:

* real conversion flows
* curated product storytelling
* scalable data structures
* and integrations beyond the web (WhatsApp, CRM, analytics)

It’s built with intention, not shortcuts.
